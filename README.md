# Professor Profiler

This project helps students analyze past exam papers (PDFs) to find statistical trends and high-yield topics. It uses a Hub-and-Spoke architecture with one orchestrator and three specialist sub-agents.

## Next Steps to Submit

1.  **Save these files**: Create the folders (`profiler_agent`, `profiler_agent/sub_agents`, `tests`) and save the files as indicated.

2.  **Get PDF Data**: Find 3-4 old exam papers (or create dummy PDFs). I have created three dummy PDFs in `tests/sample_data`: `physics_2022.pdf`, `physics_2023.pdf`, and `physics_2024.pdf`.

3.  **Run it**: Use `adk web` to start the interface.
